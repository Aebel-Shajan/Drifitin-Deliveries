## Description
A 3d car drifting game set in a city. The aim is to deliver as many pizzas to the victims (They die when you ram into them at full speed).


## Technologies Used
This project was made using three js for rendering the 3d graphics and cannon-es to simulate the physics. I used webpack as the bundler, which took many years of my life ðŸ˜­.
